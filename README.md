#OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
This CSS code provides styles for a simple webpage layout, with a header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer. Here's a breakdown of each part:

body
Font: Sets the font family to Arial, with a fallback to sans-serif if Arial is unavailable.
Margins and padding: Removes the default margin and padding from the body element, ensuring thereâ€™s no unwanted spacing around the page content.
Background: Sets the background color to a light grey (#f4f4f4).
header
Background color: The header has a dark background (#333).
Text color: The text color is set to white for contrast.
Padding: Adds 1rem of padding to the top and bottom of the header for spacing.
nav ul
List style: Removes the default bullet points from the navigation list.
Padding: Removes any extra padding applied by default.
nav ul li
Display inline: Displays list items in a horizontal row instead of a vertical list.
Margin: Adds 1rem of space between the list items.
nav ul li a
Text color: Sets the text color of the links to white.
Text decoration: Removes the underline from the links, giving them a cleaner look.
main
Padding: Adds 2rem of padding around the content in the main section.
.course
Background color: Each course (likely representing individual sections or cards) has a white background.
Padding: Adds 1rem of padding inside each course card for spacing around the content.
Margin: Adds space (1rem) below each course card to separate them.
Border: Adds a light border (#ccc) around each course card.
footer
Text alignment: Centers the text inside the footer.
Padding: Adds 1rem of padding to the top and bottom of the footer.
Background color: Like the header, the footer has a dark background (#333).
Text color: The text color is set to white to match the header.
This layout provides a simple and clean design, making use of white spaces, easy-to-read fonts, and a color scheme that uses dark backgrounds with light text for contrast. The content is well-spaced and has a structured flow, with individual "course" elements separated for clarity.
